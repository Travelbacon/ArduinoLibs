# ArduinoLibs
Several Libs to play with

Just libs for repetitive tasks or algorithm I can't find on the web.
Programming is kept very generic to adjust it to my needs.

RBGTransition
This lib contains code to switch smoothly between two RGB settings. Nice for RGB LEDs that there is a smooth transition between blue and green
for instance.
